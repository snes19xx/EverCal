# EverCal

A simple calendar application written in Flutter.

I built this because I wanted a functional calendar that actually looked good on my Linux desktop. It is specifically designed to work seamlessly with tiling window managers like Hyprland.

## Features

* **Clean UI:** Minimalist design that fits into any workflow.
* **Theme Support:** Built-in Light and Dark modes.
* **Tiling Friendly:** Zero-client-side decorations. It relies on the window manager for borders, making it look native on Hyprland, Sway, or other compositors.
